Flask Weather API

Overview

This is a simple Flask-based Weather API that fetches real-time weather data from a free weather API and exposes it via a RESTful endpoint. The project follows SOLID principles and adheres to the 12-factor app methodology, making it modular, maintainable, and scalable.

Features

Fetch real-time weather using a free external API (WeatherAPI Free Tier).

SOLID architecture: Uses blueprints, services, and utility modules for clean separation of concerns.

Custom library (weatherlib): Handles weather data processing, making it reusable.

Dependency management: Utilizes Poetry for clean installation and packaging.

CI/CD pipeline: Uses GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and deployment.

GitHub Pages deployment: Demonstrates continuous deployment by publishing documentation.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python (>= 3.9)

Poetry (dependency manager)

Flask (installed via Poetry)

GitHub account (for CI/CD setup)

Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-weather-api.git
cd flask-weather-api

Install Poetry (if not already installed):

pip install poetry

Install dependencies:

poetry install

Set up environment variables (modify .env or set manually):

FLASK_APP=app
FLASK_ENV=development
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

Run the Flask application:

poetry run flask run

Access the API:
Open a browser or use curl:

curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/weather/current?city=Paris"

API Endpoints

GET /weather/current?city=CityName

Fetches the current weather for a given city.

Request Parameters

city (string, required) – Name of the city.

Example Request

curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/weather/current?city=Paris"

Example Response

{
  "condition":"Sunny",
  "location":"Paris",
  "temperature_c":5.3,
  "temperature_f":41.54
}

Error Responses

400 Bad Request: If no city is provided.

500 Internal Server Error: If there is an issue fetching data from the external API.

Running Tests

To ensure everything is working, run the test suite using unittest:

poetry run python -m unittest discover -v

This runs all unit tests located in the tests/ directory.

Linting & Code Quality

We use pylint for enforcing code quality:

poetry run pylint app weatherlib

CI/CD Pipeline

This project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that:

Runs linting (using pylint).

Runs unit tests (using unittest).

Deploys documentation to GitHub Pages.

To see the latest build status, check the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.

Deployment

GitHub Pages Deployment

Although Flask is a backend framework, this project deploys documentation to GitHub Pages as a demonstration of continuous deployment.

CI/CD automatically deploys docs when changes are pushed to the main branch.

The deployed site can be accessed via https://yourusername.github.io/flask-weather-api/ (after enabling GitHub Pages in repo settings).

Future Enhancements

Add support for multiple weather providers (e.g., Open-Meteo, WeatherAPI, etc.).

Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance.

Support unit selection (Celsius/Fahrenheit) via query parameters.

Expand documentation with an interactive Swagger UI for better API visualization.
